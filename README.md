The goal of this project is to construct a dataset to train a machine learning model for the WINTER telescope at Mt. Palomar, aimed at determining which sources detected by WINTER are real. This 'real-bogus' algorithm sifts through WINTER data to differentiate between astrophysical objects and artifacts. To build this model, the students crossmatched the entire WINTER database with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) database, as the ZTF real-bogus algorithm is robust and sources present in both databases are likely real. The final, updated dataset includes a broader sample of sources, allowing for more effective training of the real-bogus algorithm. Each source is assigned a score that can later be used to filter through the vast amounts of data collected by WINTER.
